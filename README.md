## Overview
I built a card component for an imaginary website from a challenge I found on frontendmentor.io

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of flexbox and I am glad that I was able to use the block element modifier principles to help me write clean and maintainable css code.

### Continued development

For future projects, I will be working on fully fledged websites, I am still new to web development, only 16 years old at the time this project was published, I need to learn react.js to make my websites more interactive, but I am mastering html and css gradually.
### Useful resources

- [Mosh Hamedani's course on HTML and CSS](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-html-css) - This course was a refresher for my web development skills and taught me most of what I know now, made it very easy for me to complete this challenge.
